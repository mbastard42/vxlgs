# VXLGS

A voxel-based **Rust** game engine experimenting with **realistic physics** and **ray-marching rendering** to explore modern GPU techniques and **modular** engine design.

## Documentation

The documentation begins [[here]](doc/0.0.index.md) and covers the architectural design, optimization processes, and development guidelines.

Although the code is self-documented, you can also generate the developer documentation locally with:

```bash
cargo doc --open --no-deps --document-private-items 
```
